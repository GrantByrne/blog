Update
I originally wrote this proof of concept about 7 years ago early in my time with WPF. I published it on an earlier iteration of my blog via Github Gist and Wordpress (You can find the gist here). After which point I pretty much forgot out it.
I recently came across the Gist and found that it has helped out a surprising number of people. So, it makes sense to me to pull this in to a blog and annotate it a bit better.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Autofac with Caliburn Micro v3.2.0 and Autofac v4.8.1</title><link>/posts/settingupautofacwithcaliburnmicro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 22:40:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/settingupautofacwithcaliburnmicro/</guid><description>
I find myself frequently setting up new projects with Caliburn Micro; however, It isnâ€™t always easy to remember the code to integrate Autofac with the bootstrapper. So, here is the template that I use when creating a new application.
public class ClientBootstrapper : BootstrapperBase { private static IContainer Container; public ClientBootstrapper() { this.Initialize(); } protected override void Configure() { var builder = new ContainerBuilder(); builder.RegisterType&amp;lt;WindowManager&amp;gt;() .AsImplementedInterfaces() .SingleInstance(); builder.RegisterType&amp;lt;EventAggregator&amp;gt;() .AsImplementedInterfaces() .SingleInstance(); Container = builder.</description></item></channel></rss>
