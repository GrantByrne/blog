Update
I originally wrote this proof of concept about 7 years ago early in my time with WPF. I published it on an earlier iteration of my blog via Github Gist and Wordpress (You can find the gist here). After which point I pretty much forgot out it.
I recently came across the Gist and found that it has helped out a surprising number of people. So, it makes sense to me to pull this in to a blog and annotate it a bit better.</description></item></channel></rss>
