Hello World!

After multiple attempts in the past I'm looking to start blogging again.

In this iteration, I'm using an Amazon S3 bucket serving up a static site that is generated with Hugo. So far I'm pretty happy with the results.

In future iterations of the site, I'm planning to:

- Add tagging support to the posts
- Add the google analytics tag
- Make some adjustments to the theme to make it even more lightweight
- Add a landing page so this website is more than just a blog
- Add references to the other sites where I spend my time: Github and Instagram.

Thanks for ready and see you in the next post!
